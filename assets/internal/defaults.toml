# KYCo Internal Defaults
# ======================
# This file contains the built-in agents that ship with KYCo.
# These are automatically merged into user configs based on version numbers.
#
# VERSION POLICY:
# - Bump the version when changing an agent
# - Higher versions will override user customizations (by design)
# - If you want to keep a user's customizations, don't bump the version
#
# SKILLS:
# Skills are loaded from SKILL.md files in:
# - Project-local: `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
# - Global: `~/.kyco/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
#
# Create skills with: kyco skill create <name> --description "..."
# See https://agentskills.io/specification for the SKILL.md format.
#
# CHAINS:
# Chains are user-defined sequences of skills. Create them in the GUI
# or with: kyco chain set <name> --steps skill1,skill2,skill3
